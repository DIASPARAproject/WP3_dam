# Design an international database for storing dam data (deliverable D3.3)

To assess available habitat, turbine-induced mortality and more generally river continuity, a database of migration obstacles and hydropower facilities is essential. This database extends the work of previous projects (e.g. Sudoang and AMBER) and aims to provide a comprehensive inventory of barriers and obstacles for migratory species, as well as the data required to quantify the impacts on upstream and downstream passage. The task aims to feed the assessment of river continuity in the context of the WFD and the free-flowing river target of EU Biodiversity Strategy.
Subtasks
1. Identify the needs of different working groups.
2. Discuss interoperability and storage with ICES, JRC, and potential data providers such as Amber.
3. Propose a database structure for migration obstacles and hydropower dams needed to support an assessment of upstream and downstream migration.
4. Test the functionality of the dam database with data provided by the project partners.
